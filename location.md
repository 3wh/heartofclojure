## Hal5, Leuven, Belgium, Europe

Heart of Clojure is a conference by and for the European Clojure Community, and so we chose a location that's easily accessible from across Europe.

From Brussels Airport it's only a fifteen minute train ride and a five minute walk to get to the venue. People from neighbouring countries we encourage to take the train. If you're coming from London, Paris, Amsterdam, or Cologne then you can ride comfortably up to our doorstep.

We chose to organize Heart of Clojure in Leuven, a university city with a rich past, and with plenty of hospitality to offer.

The historic center is largely car-free, and easily navigated on foot, making it a visitor friendly destination. With hundreds of years of history, many local breweries and a small walkable core it's a perfect playground for the community to mingle.

### The venue

[Hal5](http://hal5.be) consists of former warehouses used by the Belgian Railways. Today it is a buzzing neighbourhood hub with a food court, urban gym, bakery, and coffee roastery.
