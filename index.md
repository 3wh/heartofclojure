## To: The European Clojure Community

We'd like to warmly invite you to **Heart of Clojure**, a new Clojure conference coming to [Leuven, Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuven), on 2nd and 3rd August 2019.

With **Heart of Clojure** we want to bring something new and fresh to the Clojure conference scene, a summer gathering where Clojurists and Clojure-curious of all backgrounds can meet, mix and mingle.

We're looking for technical talks that get to the heart of Clojure, but also for ways to put the heart in Clojure. We want to recognize that programming is not just about code but about community, diversity, and the societal impact and ethical implications of our work.

There will be plenty of time to relax and socialize, and to participate in activities around the venue and around town; this is the holiday season after all.

All of this is happening at the heart of Europe, a short train ride away from Brussels Airport, and with fast and convenient rail connections to European tech hubs like London, Paris, Amsterdam, and the Ruhr area. We encourage people from all over Europe to come and enjoy this unique event with us.

Sounds good or you want to hear more? Then sign up for the mailing list or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/heartofclojure).
